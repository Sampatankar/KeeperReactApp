# KeeperReactApp
First React Tutorial App - AppBrewery

This is a simple app to keep and take notes, much like the notes app on Android phones.  It is coded in React syntax, on top of the CSS and MaterialiseUI components.

The app has a UI with a yellow header band, a footer with copyright and dynamic year (in a component).  The Note input box will animate from one row to three when clicked on, and there is an animated 'add' button.  The notes allow for Titles and content portions, and each note can be individually deleted.
This requires the use of map() and filter() functions, as well as state changes and React hooks/props.

This app comes from completing the challenges posed by the 9-hour React bonus course as part of the 2020 Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu's AppBrewery. A course hosted on Udemy.com
